# Engine

This class provides the basics for starting a game build with SDL.<br>

# Engine 2

The idea in the Engine 2 class is to create an environment independent of the Game library, for possible replacement if necessary.<br>

# Small Tool Box

It is a set of classes and functions to assist in construction.<br>

# State

It is a namespace with common enumerations (nomenclatures) to facilitate understanding the state of the game.<br>
